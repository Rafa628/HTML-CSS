    <h2>easy recipe made in 25 minutes</h2>
    <p>Perfect for nugget lovers!  This easy beef milanesa recipe has the crunch of a nugget with a different protein. It's also a little more grow up food friendly than chicken nuggets, making it perfect as a family dinner dish for sure! My kiddos ask for this weekly and it's a great alternative to processed foods.</p>
    <p>This recipe calls for breaded top round cutlet beef, which is generally more affordable. You can feed a large crowd without breaking the bank. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1lb Thin Cut Eye of Round Steak</li>
      <li>1.5 Cup Flour</li>
      <li>3 Eggs</li>
      <li>1 Cup Panko</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>Â½ Teaspoon Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
      <li>3 Tablespoons Cooking Oil</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Start by setting up your dredging station. One bowl of flour, one of your eggs and one of the panko, giving each bowl a generous sprinkle of the seasoning</li>
    <li>First coat the steak in flour, then dip the steak into the egg wash. Next coat the steak in panko. Repeat until all steaks are dredged. (Tip: Start by patting steak dry paper towel to ensure coatings stick.)</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in frying pan, over medium-high heat and pan fry the breaded steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side or until breading has browned. Work in batches, if necessary, making sure to not overcrowd the pan. Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
