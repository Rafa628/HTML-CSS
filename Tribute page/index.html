    <p>Martin Luther King, a civil rights activist from a very young age, organized and carried out various peaceful activities demanding the right to vote, non-discrimination and other basic civil rights for black people in the United States. Among his most remembered actions are the bus boycott in Montgomery, in 1955; his support for the foundation of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), in 1957 (of which he would be its first president); and the leadership of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, in August 1963, at the end of which he would deliver his famous speech "I have a dream" ("I have a dream"), thanks to which it would spread throughout public awareness of the civil rights movement throughout the country and would establish himself as one of the greatest speakers in American history. Most of the rights claimed by the movement would be approved with the enactment of the Bill of Rights Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
